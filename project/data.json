In the United States, the <abbr title=\"Advanced Research Projects Agency Network\">ARPANET</abbr> had already proven the use of <abbr title=\"Packet Switching Technology\">packet switching</abbr> as a reliable way of connecting computers across distances. These early experiments became the reference model for many nations, including Brazil, that aimed to build their own academic networks.",
